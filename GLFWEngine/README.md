GLFWEngine
==========

I got tired of having to setup everything every time I wanted to play with OpenGL so this was the result of experimenting with modular design. Each demo has it's own logic regarding rendering and keyboard/mouse input hence, I united these under a common single interface and allowed for them to be managed seamlessly.
