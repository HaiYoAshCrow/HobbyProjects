GLFWEngine
==========

I got tired of having to setup everything every time I wanted to play with OpenGL so this was the result of experimenting with modular design. Each demo has it's own logic regarding rendering and keyboard/mouse input hence, I united these under a common single interface and allowed for them to be managed seamlessly. My expanded notes and thoughts on it's development can be found here: https://placeofmemory.wordpress.com/2013/11/24/a-very-simple-glfw-project-framework/
